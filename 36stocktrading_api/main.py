    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

stock_parameters = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol": STOCK_NAME,

# another way to do this instead of using datetime is with a list comprehension
data = stock_response.json()["Time Series (Daily)"] # this is a dict
# [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
data_list = [value for (key, value) in data.items()] # items() turns dict into a list
yesterday_data = data_list[0]
yesterday_closing_price = yesterday_data["4. close"]

#2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
day_before_close = float(stock_data["Time Series (Daily)"][day_before]["4. close"])
# or
day_before_closing_price = data_list[1]["4. close"]

#3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
positive_diff = (yesterday_close - day_before_close)
up_down = None
if positive_diff > 0:

else:

#4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
percent_diff = round(positive_diff / yesterday_close * 100)

#5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
   ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
   
if abs(percent_diff) > 2:
    news_parameters = {

    news_response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters)
    news_response.raise_for_status()

#7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation
    article_list = news_data["articles"][:3]
    
    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
    # [new_item for item in list]
    formatted_articles = [f"{STOCK_NAME}: {up_down}{percent_diff}%\nHeadline: {article['title']}. \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in article_list]
   
    
    # for article in article_list:
    #     title = article["title"]
    #     print(title)
#9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
